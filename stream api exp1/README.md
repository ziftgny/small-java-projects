The Book class consists of variables such as the book title, page count, author's name, and publication date.

Create 10 objects from the Book class and store them in an ArrayList structure. Using the stream and lambda expressions, create a new Map<String, String> where the book title corresponds to the author's name.

Filter the books with more than 250 pages from this list of 10 Book objects and provide it as a new list. (You can use Stream and Lambda expressions for this.)
